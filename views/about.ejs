        <h2>Why this Project?</h2>
        <h4>Have you ever been somewhere that just completely changes your perspective?</h4>
        <p>I lived in Washington State for a few years, and in order to become an honorary Washintonian I was taken by some friends to picnic on "The Mountain".
            Now whent they say "The Mountain" what they really mean is Mt. Rainier, and by "on" the mountain, they meant close enough to appreciate it but not close enough to require a hike.
            When I stepped out of the car, Mt. Rainier was so close I felt like I could reach out and touch it. It took up almost the entirety of my field of view.
            I did what anyone would do in my situation...
        </p>
        <h4>I had an existential crisis.</h4>
        <p>Now, I wouldn't say I'm "pro existential crisis", however that moment changed the trajectory of my whole life.
            I wanted to see more, I wanted to learn, and the only thing stopping me from more experiences like this was my health.
            So I got stronger, I got healthier, and I started to explore. 
        </p>
        <p>I now know from looking through all the data the National Park Service provides that they do so much more than just maintaining these parks.
            I began this project to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I continued it because it was fun.
            I hope you enjoy it too.
        </p>
